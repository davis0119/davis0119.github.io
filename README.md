Here's my repository for my personal website. I'll showcase a bit about myself and what I do as an aspiring software engineer. 

Some resources/documentation: 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (building my website) 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (hosting my website)
[Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/docs.html) (icons used)
[Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) (hosting my website locally)
[Ruby Gem](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/#gems) (to read up on gems, will be using Jekyll)

As always with ruby, always:
```
bundle install
```
To build and start site on local server
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
To view, go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
